Project 1: A Random Quote Generator

- Create a quote object that has a quote, an author, a year and a citation.
- Set up an array of quote objects
- Set up a function that gets a random quote
- Set up a function that renders it to the browser

- Extras: 
-- More properties in the quote object, like category (or think of something clever)
-- Time-based setInterval() thing that refreshes the quote automatically
-- Random background colour when the quote changes
